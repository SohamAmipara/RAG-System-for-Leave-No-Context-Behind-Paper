# RAG System for "Leave No Context Behind" Paper

## Overview

This project aims to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using the LangChain framework to answer questions based on the "Leave No Context Behind" paper published by Google on 10th April 2024. The system utilizes the power of LLM (Language Model) like Gemini 1.5 Pro and external data sources such as PDFs and text files to enhance the question-answering capabilities.

## Setup

To run the RAG system, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/SohamAmipara/RAG-System-for-Leave-No-Context-Behind-Paper.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Ensure you have the necessary API key from Google.

4. Run the `app.py` file using Streamlit:

```
streamlit run app.py
```

## Files

- `app.py`: Python script containing the implementation of the RAG system.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python libraries.
- `data_paper.pdf`: PDF file of the "Leave No Context Behind" paper.

## Usage

Once the application is running, enter your question in the text input field and click the "Submit" button to receive the answer generated by the RAG system.
